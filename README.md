# TMDB Score Prediction and Movie Recommendation

Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s hectic world. People are always in the lookout for products/services that are best suited for them. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.
In this kernel, I will build a Movie Recommendation System using collaborative filtering by implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. I will also predict the rating of the given movie based on its neighbors and compare it with the actual rating.
